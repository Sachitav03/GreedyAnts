    <h2>Welcome to GreedyAnts!</h2>

This project aims to encourage sustainable practices and decrease food waste. In 2018, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that food waste takes up about 24% (one-fourth) of landfill waste with other items taking up less. This means food waste is the biggest category in the landfill waste. 
<br></br>
Food waste presents a significant danger to the environment because the food cannot completely decompose in the landfills. As a result, the food produces methane, and methane is a greenhouse gas that traps in more heat than carbon dioxide and contributes to global warming. A lot of resources go into the mass production of food, but 30-40% of food produce is never consumed. 
<br></br>
To reduce food waste, we want to promote consuming forgotten ingredients by generating recipes that include those ingredients. These recipes come from Epicurious, and we hope to increase awareness around food waste and encourage exploring new recipes.
